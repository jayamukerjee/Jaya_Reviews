								Starting strong with one of my all-time favourite movies. How to Train Your Dragon is just one of those movies you can come back to and watch over, and over again. It has an amazing soundtrack, and it probably started my obsession with listening to the scores of movies. The storyline is amazing, and it has a satisfying emotional conclusion with great pacing throughout the movie leading up to it. There are three movies in the trilogy with three shows taking place between the first two movies and a few specials scattered around the timeline. The movies are based off the How to Train Your Dragon books by Cressida Cowell and think I've read almost all of them, but the movies are very different from the books, so you don't have to read any of the books to enjoy the films. A solid 20/10 rating, this movie is actually perfect. If you haven’t already, go watch it right now, you will not be disappointed.

							This is the most recent Studio Ghibli film I’ve watched, so I wanted to talk about it. I thought it had a really engaging plot line, but it was casual enough for me to just purely enjoy the movie without thinking too much about it. The animation is classic Studio Ghibli so of course it looks good, nothing really to talk about there. The thing that caught my attention the most throughout this film was the soundtrack. It was very whimsical and light, but it got dramatic when there were tense scenes. Most Ghibli movies have great soundtracks but this one kind of just stuck with me. My two favourite tracks were "A Town with an Ocean View" and "Un Unusual Painting" which are both in the playlist on the home page. Overall, this film was really enjoyable and I’d definitely recommend watching it.

								This is basically my childhood film. I watched it all the time growing up, and a lot of videos that my sister and I took on our iPad had this movie playing in the background. The songs are timeless classics that many people would be able to recognise even if they’ve never watched the movie. The animated original released in 1994, and in 2019 Disney made a live action remake of it. I did go and watch it, but it wasn’t the best. It felt a bit flat and lifeless compared to the original and it didn’t have the same charm. The only thing I liked better was the more diverse voice actors honestly. Anyway, ignoring the remake, I will always have a soft spot in my heart for The Lion King, and it is a must watch.

								 When I first watched the trailer, I thought this was going to be a knock off Aladdin, so I was kind of sceptical going into it. But after watching it I can confidently say that it isn’t. Mostly. It has some of the same concepts, like a magical being that grants three wishes, and the main character fakes being rich to achieve something, and the villain wants to have the magical being to grant their own wishes and pursues it throughout the movie. But I think that writers purposely made it like Aladdin and then subverted expectations with a different story. This movie has a lot of sweet scenes and humorous ones too, and it’s altogether a fun movie experience that’s not too serious. It’s not a must watch, but if you’re ever bored this one is a good movie to put on. Also, I’m aware that this trailer kind of reveals the whole plot for the movie, but it’s a Netflix trailer, what can you do. And also, the trailer makes it seem like it’s completely a kids movie, but honestly in my opinion I think any age can enjoy this movie on some level.

								I watched Jurassic World (2015) before I watched Jurassic Park (1993) which honestly didn’t really change how I viewed the movie, but I thought I should mention it. Anyway…I love this movie a lot, mostly because of the iconic theme by John Williams. Everyone knows that theme and it built the foundation of the Jurassic franchise, whenever I hear it, I get chills. This movie was more of a thriller/horror instead of an adventure which was cool to see especially compared to how some of the more recent Jurassic movies feel, and from what I’ve heard it’s more like the book it’s based on than the other movies. I haven’t read the book yet however so I can’t comment on that. The CGI and animatronics were groundbreaking for the time, and it still holds up today. I know dinosaurs aren’t everyone’s cup of tea, but this movie is such a good watch and it’s very immersive.

								Okay, so to start out, I LOVE THESE BOOKS SO MUCH. They’re probably one of my favourite book series ever. And the movies were really good. Just nowhere near as good as the books. The first movie was missing a few plot points that weren’t necessary in the movie but are pretty significant, however if you haven’t read the book it wouldn’t make difference. The movie still carries the same message though and is very thrilling and engaging to watch, so if you’ve read the books but are sceptical about the films I think they’re worth watching. And if books aren’t your thing and you like dystopian stories with deep undercut themes about politics and oppressive societies, then you should watch this/these movies. Emotional warning though, and don’t get attached to any character. But it’s a good series!

								This is also another movie adaptation of a dystopian book series, and I have to confess…I’ve never read this series. So I won’t be able to talk about its authenticity to its source material, but I can comment on the movie and its story. I really enjoyed this movie, I thought it had good pacing, it had good tension and action scenes and an intriguing plot. I am going to eventually read the books and maybe my opinion will change, but for now I really like it. Also, this has nothing to do with the story or anything, but I just wanted to mention that The Maze Runner, The Hunger Games and Divergent (a book and movie series that I have not read/watched yet) are like the big three of dystopian series in my mind. Anyway, you should watch this movie and if you like reading, read the books too, you might even read them before me.

								A while ago I was bored and felt like watching a low stake, funny rom-com, so I started watching this movie on a whim. And it was exactly that, which I’m not complaining about at all. I definitely enjoyed this movie more than I thought I would, and I think that’s a lot to do with the chemistry the two main characters (Andy Samberg and Cristin Milioti) had with each other. The plot was about a time loop, which has been done so many times in so many ways, and I really like how they did this one. It was a very chill movie with a sweet ending and a lot of moment that made me smile, a good movie to watch when you just want to relax.

								Last year I made it my mission to watch all the Marvel movie in cinematic order because I had never properly watched them enough to get a grasp on the universe, and I did until Avengers: Endgame. When I watched the first Avengers movie, it was was after all the buildup in individual movies and it was the first time they all worked and fought together, so I was very hyped going into it. And it delivered on that hype. Obviously it wasn’t as high stakes as Avengers: Infinity War or Endgame, but it was a significant movie in the MCU because it was the first movie with the original Avengers. It’s not my favourite Marvel movie but I enjoyed it immensely.

								This movie has arguably one of my favourite tropes ever which is found family. I adore that trope so much. Also, the dynamic of the main characters is so amusing but also sweet because they all found somewhere that they belonged. And the songs they play in this movie is top tier honestly such a vibe. If you like a light-hearted movie with occasional emotional beats definitely check this movie out.

								Thor Ragnarok is the best Thor movie in my opinion. It’s funny, the characters have excellent chemistry with each other, Valkyrie got introduced to the main team, and Thor and Loki were working together and portraying an accurate sibling dynamic. This movie definitely does up there in my Marvel ranking because it’s so rewatchable and interesting.

								Now this might be one of my favourite Marvel movies, for many different reasons. One, the score for this movie was immaculate. It was the perfect mix of eerie and off putting, and dramatic for an espionage thriller about Captain America. Two, it has one of my favourite duos: Captain America and Black Widow who get a lot of screentime with each other. And three, it felt very different from the previous Marvel projects, and it was the perfect mix of action and espionage/spy stuff. All the main characters got character developments that felt right, and the movie was extremely well paced. Overall, this film is so good, and you HAVE to watch it, though maybe watch the first Captain America movie first for context. But if you’re not into superheroes or Marvel that’s fine obviously, don’t feel compelled to watch it just because I aggressively told you to. (seriously watch it)

							Okay…so, I watched this recently. I was extremely sceptical going into it. And I still am. Don’t get me wrong, it was a very good live action adaptation and was very faithful to the original. But it just didn’t need to exist in the first place. It didn’t bring anything new to the table, it didn’t elevate the original story in any impactful way, and it didn’t carry over the same charm the original had. I did like the movie, and it was probably one of the best live action remakes so far, but it was just meh. It felt kind of like a watered-down version of the original movie, in my opinion, I know a lot of people really liked it. Honestly if you want to watch How to Train Your Dragon, just watch the animated one, it is so much better.

							I AM SO EXCITED FOR THIS MOVIE. OMG. I loved the first movie, Wicked, and I have watched it so many times already. And then when the trailer for Wicked For Good dropped, I watched it like ten times in a row, I was so excited. My favourite song from the musical is in part two, so even more reason for the excitement. It looks like it will be incredible and just as good as the first part, so I’m ready. I’m literally already sitting in the theatre.
