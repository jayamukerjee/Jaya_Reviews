					Hi, my name is Jaya. This website is basically where I talk about my opinions on various media products and talk about whether I like them or not and why. I do recommend you watch all the products I like and even watch the ones I don’t like to see if you feel the same way. I have tried to keep it spoiler free, but some I can’t help but spoil so mild spoiler warning going into it. However, I do have to say I don’t spoil anything major. I hope you enjoy reading these.

					I was originally going to have a music page but that idea got scrapped, however here is a playlist with some of my favourite soundtracks/scores from some of the movies and shows I like, feel free to listen.
