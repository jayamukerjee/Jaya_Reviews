						I think this is one of my favourite shows ever, for too many reasons to write here, but these are the main ones. One, the word building is super immersive and has so much potential. It is just based off the four elements and the creators managed to build a high functioning world with different laws of magic and different nations based off real life cultures and communities. Two, it covers themes like colonialism and the cycle of war and violence, and how trauma affects different people. Three, I love all the main characters in this show (except for one) and they are all super dynamic and nuanced and undergo amazing character development. Zuko I’m looking at you. Four, the show is just really enjoyable to watch, and it takes you on a journey of hope and love, I honestly wish I could rewatch it for the first time again. Avatar The Last Airbender is a show you must watch otherwise you are doing something wrong in life. :)
						Also, the trailer on the right is a fan made trailer of the whole show and it doesn’t contain any major spoilers so you can watch it if you haven’t watched the show yet.

						Despite many people hating this show, I love The Legend of Korra. It did stumble here and there, but by the third season it was honestly amazing. The things I specifically like in TLOK was the fight sequences, they were incredibly fluid and immersive, and quite fast and animated well. Another thing I loved was the music. I think I liked the music in TLOK more than in ATLA if I’m being honest, but I think that’s just a personal preference. I found Korra to be a relatable character and after seeing her struggles and how she overcame them, I found it easy to root for her. In my opinion I think this show is over hated, but I can’t talk about all the reason for that right now, it would be too long. I think after watching Avatar, you should give this show a chance and persist through season two, because season three is my favourite and it has the best villain in the show in my opinion.

					I thought this would be a fun little show for me to watch to forget about my troubles. And it started out like that. And then it got serious. Okay I’m being dramatic, but this show is seriously amazing. It’s a classic story about kids who gets transported into a fantasy realm and survive in different ways, making different friends along the way, and then get superpowers to defeat the villain in the end. This show feels fresh, and the world feels well thought out and immersive, and the comedy is impeccable. It can feel a bit childish sometimes, but then it gets deep and emotional and leaves you wondering if this is actually a kids show. Especially in the later seasons. So be prepared when watching it, which you should by the way. Watch it.

						This is one of comfort shows, I can just put on any episode whenever because they are all good. This show is funny, it has loveable characters, and a romance to root for from season one. It also tackles some more serious topics in a natural way and handles them with respect. It’s a good casual show to watch whenever you want.
